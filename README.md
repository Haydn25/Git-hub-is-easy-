This is a linked repository to a project 'Chocolate' I am conducting and have started on the Open Science Framework. 
Chocolate is a pseudo project for a purpose of a workshop that contains no data and has not been registered. 
I created this link so that my files, data and scripts can be easily and openly transfered to my project. 
This enables clear transparency of my data
