This is a linked repository to a project 'Chocolate' I am conducting and have started on the Open Science Framework. 
Chocolate is a pseudo project for the purpose of a workshop that contains no data and has not been registered. 
I created this link so that my files, data and scripts can be easily and openly transfered to my project through GitHub. 
This enables clear and transparent data that is version controlled.
